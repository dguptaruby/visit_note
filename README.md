# visit_note

Hello there, 



I have created this small app with rails and Vue.js in which I added

1. one text field for signature which is used to identify therapist and map note to therapist.
2. one field for note
3. then breaking note into goal,error and total as per mentioned in description.
And here What I would do if I have more time

1. Add authentication and login for therapist
2. Patient model to map note with patients
3. add dashboard to show progress of patient in graph.
4. more text fields for better understanding
5. model for goals define by therapists.
6. functionality to share patient report between therapist so that if  therapist changes patient report can be used to continue.
